# Christmas Hack for Tech WednesDay at SixNationsPolytechnic
For my last #TechWednesDay of 2019 at SixNationsPolytechnic I wanted to leave the Students with something 
they can take home at the end of our class. 
I remembered that we had the PlayBulbs LED candles form last year so I came up with this little hack 
to turn the candle into a light for a hat/toque to be visible at night. Here the fished project 
(Hack) an App controlled Hat LED.
